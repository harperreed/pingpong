## Project Notes

Starting a new Rust TUI ping utility project. Harper (Harp Dog) wants something robust and pretty for monitoring connectivity in low-bandwidth environments like planes.

Current project structure is minimal - just basic Cargo.toml and main.rs. Need to flesh out the architecture.

Key dependencies I'm thinking:
- ratatui for TUI
- tokio for async runtime
- surge-ping or similar for ICMP
- serde + toml for configuration
- clap for CLI args
- crossterm for terminal handling

Architecture plan:
- Config module for loading predefined hosts
- Ping engine with async ping execution
- Stats collection and analysis
- TUI module with multiple views
- Event handling for user input

The "pretty" requirement suggests we need good visual design - graphs, colors, clean layout. Ratatui's widgets should handle this well.
